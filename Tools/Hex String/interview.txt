When answering questions, please be as specific as possible.  More
information is better than too little.  I may send follow up questions after
receiving your responses to the questions below.  The final article, only to
be published to my private clientele, will be run by you for a review prior
to publication.  This ensures accuracy and privacy for you.  I look forward
to your prompt reply.

  I use Norton AntiVirus 2002.

Virus Creation History
* How did you get started as a virus author?  What is your motive?
  My first contact with virii was on April 26th 1999 when Chernobyl must be activated
  1 year after its creation. The computers of the scool was infected the same day.
  I began to interested in virii and 7 months after, I code my first worm : I-Worm.MadCow.

* What is your education and how did you learn how to write viruses and other malicious code?
  I began to search some informations on the net. I was a lame. And I buy a CD-ROM with many
  virus and code of DOS virii. After, I can buy an excellent book about virii with source.
  Later, I downloaded many EZine (29A, MATRiX, CodeBreaker, etc...)

* What virus related groups have you been a member of and/or organized yourself?
  I am not a member of virii group. I ask to 29A group, but I think that my codes
  are not enough good.

* What virus related groups are you currently involved with?
  I contributed at 29A#6 with 2 articles and one worm (I-Worm.MaLoTeYa).

* What virus creations do you take credit for?  Did you create them yourself or were other individuals involved?

* Has your computer ever been infected with a virus?  If so, what one – explain your situation.
  Yes, I wanted to debug a virus (W32.HLLP.Scrambler.E by Gigabyte) and I execute by error the virus.
  I re-installed Windows.

* Do you have any interesting virus related stories to share with us?
  No sorry.

Mentors
* What individuals in the underground have been the most helpful to you and your virus related activities?
  Benny (of the 29A group) is the man who help me the best. When I had some problems,
  he always try to help me. I learnt a lot of things by reading the source of his worms and virii.
  Mandragore helped me too.

* Who do you look up to in the virus underground?
  Nothing.

* What viruses and virus creation/deployment tools are admired by you?  Why?
  I admire Benny/29A. His codes are not very complex.
  I like Worm.Nimda because it's a new sort of spread. I like virus which execute
  automatically like VBS.BubbleBoy, KaK, Nimda, etc...

Current Projects and Future Prospects
* What viruses are you currently working on, if any?
  I code the most of time worms. I like this sort of program who can spread computers by computers
  just with a double click.

* What do you plan on creating in the future?
  I want to code a multi-platform worm : spread with EXE file and DOC or XLS file. And perhaps
  worms on Linux.

* Do you foresee yourself leaving the virus scene at any point in time?  If so, why?
  I wanted to leave the VX scene on December 2001 because of the school (I was so bad).
  In 6 months, perhaps I stop because I'm going to a military school.


Opinion/Views
* What do you think of various anti-virus software products?  Which ones are
  the best and the worst, and why?
  For me, the best is AVP but I like Norton. The worst is Vilguard Antivirus.

* Do you test your virus creations against anti-virus software?  If so,
which ones and how do you test them?
  No, the only virus which attack an antivirus is Worm.Mustard. This virus modify a
  file to accept the VBS worm.

* What do you think is the future of malicious code?  What is looming in the
near future as a significant threat?
  The danger is the lame and Virus Generator. With this sort of program, they can crash
  some computer for pleasure.

* What do you think about heuristic engines on the market today?  Are they
any good?  If not, how do you easily bypass them – please explain.

* What are the more common methods that you know of for seeding malicious
code into the wild?  Do you believe that virus authors are more hesitant to
release viruses into the wild in light of new laws and prosecution thereof?

* How easy do you think it is for the average person to get new and powerful
viruses, to modify and release into the wild?
