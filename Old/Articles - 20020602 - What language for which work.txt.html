# Introducion: #
################

Often new coders (like newbies) ask oneself what is the best language to code
virus - worms. So I try to present the different languages that I use to code
my works. First I  present the compile languages  (Win32Asm - C/C++ - VB) and
second the script language.



################
# 1) Win32asm: # THE BEST
################

It's by far the best way  to code virus/worms. You can all control with this.
This language is useful for a good  infection. Today, 98 % of virii are coded
in  assembler. There are  different ways to spread  worms too.
First the MAPI functions. Look at my works (and others) to see  the syntax.
Other way : SMTP. It's a good device to deceive the victims. They can believe
that an email come from a  company (support@microsoft.com) or himself. But it
is a difficult  language in the  biginning. See, read and learn tutorials and
other viriis/worms' source.

# 2) C/C++: #
#############

I learnt this language 6 months ago. Advantage, the syntax is as easy as ASM.
It's especially a language to code worms thanks to &lt;mapi.h&gt;.
You can spread you work by reading old mails or scan some WEB files but also
by coding a SMTP processus.
This language is equally use to code worms that use IIS server to spread like
the worm : W32.Nimda.Worm.
With this language, you can code virii/worms' linux too.

# 3) VB: #
##########

Of course it's a lame language. But you can use the Outlook's Address Book to
spread your work without effort. But this sort  of program are  fast detected
by AV (Norton : Bloodhound.W32.VBWORM).
Personnaly, I use this language to code some tools like Virii/Worms Generator
or other things.


###########
# 4) VBS: #
###########

Very easy. I learnt this language by reading the source of VBS.ILoveYou.Worm.
You can easy make a good parasit virus  and worm with Outlook's Address Book.
Remark : VBS is a  Micro$oft language. So  you can travel  throught different
Micro$oft software like Outlook (of course) but also with Word.
If you want to read good source coded in VBS, look at Zulu homepage.


############
# 5) HTML: #
############

With this language, the most interesting are the virii. Of course you code in
VBS language (or in JavaScript). This is the same syntax. Try to find a new
sort of spreading.


###########
# 6) VBA: #
###########

If you know the VBS language, you don't will have problemz to code a macro
virus (DOC / XLS). To code macro virii is easiest thing in the VX life. So
you must find novelties (new way to infect DOC files, infect DOC/XLS files
or spread throught DOC/EXE files, etc...). Spread is easy too : Melissa.A.
